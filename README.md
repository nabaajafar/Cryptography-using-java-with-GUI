# Cryptography-using-java-with-GUI 
In this program we had use 3 method of cryptography
1-	Shift Cipher: By using alphabet and add a key value to replace the alphabet we can generate this technique.
2-	Affine Cipher: is a generalization of the shift cipher where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numerical values.
3-	One Time Pad: powerful encryption that cannot be break if it used in a correct way. Use random private key to do this technique using modular addition.
